## Situation
Paysera users can go to a branch to cash in and/or cash out from Paysera account. There are also commission fees for both cash in and cash out. Only supported currency is EUR.

## Commission Fees

### For Cash In
Commission fee - 0.03% from total amount, but no more than 5.00 EUR.

You can get configuration from [API](https://developers.paysera.com/tasks/api/cash-in)

### For Cash Out
There are different commission fees for cash out for natural and legal persons.

#### Natural Persons
Default commission fee - 0.3% from cash out amount.

1000.00 EUR per week (from monday to sunday) is free of charge.

If total cash out amount is exceeded - commission is calculated only from exceeded amount (that is, for 1000.00 EUR there is still no commission fee).

You can get configuration from [API](https://developers.paysera.com/tasks/api/cash-out-natural)

#### Legal persons
Commission fee - 0.3% from amount, but not less than 0.50 EUR for operation.

You can get configuration from [API](https://developers.paysera.com/tasks/api/cash-out-juridical)

### Rounding
After calculating commission fee, it's rounded to the smallest currency item (for example, for EUR currency - cents) to upper bound (ceiled). For example, 0.023 EUR should be rounded to 3 Euro cents.
